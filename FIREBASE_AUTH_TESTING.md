- Error messages should be user-friendly

### 3. Password Reset Testing

#### Test Case 3.1: Password Reset Flow
**Steps:**
1. Navigate to http://localhost:5174/login
2. Click "Forgot password?"
3. Enter email address: `testuser@gmail.com`
4. Click "Send Reset Instructions"
5. Check email for reset link
6. Click reset link and set new password
7. Return to app and login with new password

**Expected Results:**
- Reset email should be sent
- Success message should appear
- New password should work for login

### 4. Email Verification Testing

#### Test Case 4.1: Email Verification Flow
**Steps:**
1. Register a new account
2. Navigate to `/verify-email` page
3. Click "Resend Verification Email"
4. Check email inbox
5. Click verification link

**Expected Results:**
- Verification email should be resent
- Success message should appear
- Email verification should work

### 5. Authentication State Testing

#### Test Case 5.1: Authentication Persistence
**Steps:**
1. Log in successfully
2. Refresh the page
3. Close and reopen browser
4. Navigate directly to protected routes

**Expected Results:**
- User should remain logged in after refresh
- Authentication state should persist
- Protected routes should be accessible

#### Test Case 5.2: Route Protection
**Steps:**
1. Without logging in, try to access:
   - http://localhost:5174/
   - http://localhost:5174/create-game
   - http://localhost:5174/profile
2. Log in and try accessing the same routes

**Expected Results:**
- Unauthenticated users should be redirected to `/login`
- Authenticated users should access protected routes
- Public routes (login, signup) should redirect authenticated users to home

### 6. User Profile Integration Testing

#### Test Case 6.1: Profile Creation
**Steps:**
1. Register a new user
2. Check Firestore console for user document
3. Verify all required fields are populated

**Expected Results:**
- User document should be created in Firestore
- All default values should be set correctly
- Timestamps should be added

#### Test Case 6.2: Profile Updates
**Steps:**
1. Log in successfully
2. Navigate to profile page
3. Update profile information
4. Check Firestore for updates

**Expected Results:**
- Profile updates should save to Firestore
- `updatedAt` timestamp should be updated
- Changes should persist after logout/login

### 7. Error Handling Testing

#### Test Case 7.1: Network Error Simulation
**Steps:**
1. Disable internet connection
2. Try to register/login
3. Re-enable connection and retry

**Expected Results:**
- Appropriate network error messages should appear
- App should handle offline state gracefully
- Operations should work when connection is restored

#### Test Case 7.2: Firebase Service Errors
**Steps:**
1. Use invalid Firebase configuration (temporarily)
2. Try authentication operations

**Expected Results:**
- Graceful error handling
- User-friendly error messages
- No app crashes

## Performance Testing
